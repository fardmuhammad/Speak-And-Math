# Speak-And-Math
My attempt at recreating and extending the 1970s Texas Instruments toy "Speak &amp; Math" in Javascript (and possibly other programming environs if needed). 

Planned games/features include<br />
Original games:
- Solve It
- Write It 
- Greater Than/Less Than
- Number Stumper
- Word Problems<br />
New features
- Calculator

Using only the original sounds, I can extend the numerical range to include all rational numbers (with a precision of hundred thousandths) between -999,999,999.99999 and 999,999,999.99999   

Sounds from the Speak & Math will not be included, for fear of copyright issues.
The sounds were collected by me from my Speak & Math.

Circuitbending will not be recreated- this is a simulation of the games the system played, not an emulation of its hardware.

The Speak & Math is a registered trademark of Texas Instruments, Hasbro, or Basic Fun... one of those.... just don't sue me, K?

Current version is nothing like the original Speak & Math- it's a test to see if the sounds can be heard correctly when typing in a new number. Find the online version at fardmuhammad.com/speakmath
